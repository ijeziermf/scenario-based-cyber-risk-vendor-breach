# Cyber Risk Analysis: Third-Party Vendor Breach

**Overview:**

This project documents a scenario-based cyber risk analysis focused on a third-party vendor breach within a simulated organization. The objective was to evaluate how a security incident originating outside the organization’s direct control could translate into material business risk, including data exposure, regulatory scrutiny, operational disruption, and reputational damage. Rather than assessing vendor controls in isolation, this analysis traces a realistic threat pathway from vendor compromise through organizational impact to support executive decision-making and risk prioritization.

**Technologies & Tools Used:**

- Microsoft Word (formal risk analysis report)
- NIST SP 800-53
- Organization-defined 5×5 impact and likelihood risk matrix
- Scenario-based risk assessment methodology
- Quantitative risk scoring (Impact × Likelihood)

**Deliverable Features:**

- Scenario-based cyber risk narrative focused on third-party exposure
- Defined threat pathway illustrating vendor-to-organization impact
- Asset and data impact identification
- Quantitative inherent risk scoring using a 5×5 matrix
- Business-focused impact and likelihood analysis
- Risk treatment options with a clear recommended decision
- Executive-ready summary language

**Notes for Reviewers:**

This analysis intentionally prioritizes clarity and business relevance over technical depth. Plain English is used to describe vendor-related threat scenarios, impacts, and decisions to ensure accessibility for executive and non-technical stakeholders. Formal risk concepts and NIST-aligned structure are applied to maintain consistency, defensibility, and alignment with industry risk management practices without over-reliance on control-level detail.

**Start to Finish Process:**

The project began by defining a realistic third-party cyber risk scenario involving a vendor with access to sensitive organizational and customer data. A threat pathway was developed to demonstrate how a vendor-side security failure could escalate into direct organizational impact. Impact and likelihood were assessed using a five-by-five risk matrix to calculate inherent risk and support consistent prioritization. Risk treatment options were evaluated based on their ability to reduce likelihood and limit exposure, culminating in a mitigation-focused recommendation designed to align with organizational risk tolerance and governance expectations.

**Key Takeaways & Discoveries:**

- Third-party vendors represent a significant source of cyber risk due to limited direct control and delayed detection.
- Scenario-based analysis provides clearer insight into vendor risk than control-only or questionnaire-based assessments.
- Quantitative scoring strengthens prioritization and executive understanding of vendor-related exposure.
- Effective third-party risk management requires ongoing oversight, not one-time due diligence.

**Why Scenario-Based Analysis Matters:**

Scenario-based cyber risk analysis bridges the gap between external security failures and internal business impact. By tracing how a vendor-originated incident could realistically unfold, this approach helps leadership understand not just which vendors pose risk, but why that risk matters and where attention should be focused. This method supports more informed prioritization than abstract vendor ratings or checklist-driven assessments alone.

**Value to Cyber Risk Management:**

This project demonstrates how scenario-based analysis can be used to identify, quantify, and communicate third-party cyber risk in a way that supports governance, prioritization, and executive oversight. It highlights the role of cyber risk analysis as a decision-support function rather than a purely compliance-driven vendor management activity.

**Growth & Next Improvements:**

This project strengthened my ability to assess cyber risk introduced by external dependencies through a business and governance lens. Future iterations could expand this analysis to include vendor tiering, comparative risk scoring across multiple vendors, or integration with formal risk registers and GRC platforms to support continuous third-party risk monitoring at scale.
